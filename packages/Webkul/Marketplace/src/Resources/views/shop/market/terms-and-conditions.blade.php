<h4>No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h4>

<p>Save for Company and its affiliates, users, or anyone accessing Company Services pursuant to these Terms of Service, unless otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, no person or entity who is not a party to these Terms of Service shall have any right to enforce any term of these Terms of Service, regardless of whether such person or entity has been identified by name, as a member of a class or as answering a particular description. For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not affect the rights of any permitted assignee or transferee of these Terms.</p>

<h4>Severability; Entire Agreement</h4>

<p>If a court finds any provision of these Terms and Conditions to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the other Terms will remain valid and enforceable. These Terms, together with those items made a part of these Terms by reference, make up the entire agreement between Company and You and replaces any prior understandings or agreements, whether oral or written.</p>

<h4>Jurisdiction and Governing law</h4>

<p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration.</strong> You and Company agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section), unless otherwise required by law. Arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the dispute, will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis — class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and Company are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.</p>

<p><strong>Costs of Arbitration.</strong> Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules</p>

<p><strong>Forum.</strong> Any legal action or arbitration against related to our Services must be filed and take place in Maury County, Tennessee. For any actions not subject to arbitration, you and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal court located in Maury County, Tennessee.</p>

<p><strong>Government Exception.</strong> If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the United States (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Tennessee.</p>

<p>The next set of provisions applies to any party who sells merchandise on 2agunshow.com, including but not limited to SaaS merchants and vendors.</p>

<p>Any information made available about sales tax applicability is provided on an “as is” basis, and we do not warrant its accuracy or completeness.</p>

<p>You and we agree to cooperate reasonably in any tax-related matters or inquiries by taxing authorities.</p>

<p>You agree that you are responsible for, and will indemnify us against, any losses for any sales/use, VAT or similar transaction tax that is or may be assessed by any jurisdiction with respect to sales of items to buyers in the jurisdiction (other than taxes on our fees payable to such jurisdiction).</p>
